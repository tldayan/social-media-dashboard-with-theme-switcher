# Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher

![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This project is my solution for the Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create a responsive social media dashboard with a theme switcher functionality.

## Overview

The Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher challenge focused on building a dynamic and visually appealing dashboard that displays social media statistics. The goal was to create a design that allows users to switch between light and dark themes while maintaining a consistent layout and functionality.

I implemented the project using HTML, CSS (with SCSS), and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive dashboard. The objective was to provide users with a clear overview of their social media metrics and allow them to toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

The JavaScript logic handled the theme switching functionality, ensuring that the appropriate styles and color schemes were applied when the theme was changed. The SCSS styles were used to create a modular and maintainable CSS codebase, enabling easy customization and extension.
